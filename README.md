## Development

We have developed the client using React. Used React Router and functional components. Primarily used SASS and Bootstrap to style everything. Used React hooks for state management, and a little bit of Redux for global data such as signed-in user information. Used Axios to make API requests.

Developed REST API using Node and Express. Used MongoDB Atlas for database.

## Future Scope
1. We can put links of the various websites which show that particular movie 
2. Recommendations can be given to the logged in users based on their liked movies and liked genres
3. Emails can be sent to the users whenever new movies get added to the database which will act as a means of marketing the website too.
